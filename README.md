# Plasmic component library template

This is a template for creating a React component library to use with Plasimc. It uses Typescript and bundles to Typescript and Javascript.

It is based on the way that Plasmic bundle's it's own internal component library packages.

## Getting started

1. Clone or fork this repo
2. Go to `package.json` and set "name" to whatever you want to call your component library
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies

## How to use
1. Add your own components to the `src` folder instead of the example component.
2. Export your components in `src/index.ts` like the example
3. Run `npm run build` to build the library. It will be built in the `dist` folder

## Testing in a Plasmic nextjs Pages router app

In this project
1. Follow steps 1-3 in the `How To use` section above
2. Run `npm pack` to package the library to .tgz (which simulates what happens when you live-publish to npm but just saves a local file you can npm install later)

In your Plasmic project
1. Make sure you've already got a repo set up, connected with a Plasmic app and that your Plasmic app is using your app as it's custom app host
2. (If previously installed) Uninstall the library (`npm uninstall your-library-name`)
3. Run `npm install ./path/to/your-library-name-X.X.X.tgz` to install the library based on the local .tgz file
4. If CSS is used in your component/s: create an `_app.tsx` file in `./pages/_app.tsx` and import your CSS files as required
  * If using codegen nextjs
    ```typescript
    import { PlasmicRootProvider } from "@plasmicapp/react-web";
    import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
    import Head from "next/head";
  
    //Here we import the CSS from your library
    import 'your-library-name/dist/path/to/css/file';
  
    export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
      return (
        <PlasmicRootProvider Head={Head}>
          <Component {...pageProps} />
        </PlasmicRootProvider>
      );
    }
    ```
  * If using loader API with nextjs
    ```typescript
    import type { AppProps } from "next/app";

    //Here we import the bundled CSS from the library
    import 'your-library-name/dist/path/to/css/file';
    
    export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
      return (
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      );
    }
    ```
5. Register the components for use in plasmic studio.
 * If using codegen with nextjs, `plasmic-host.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   import * as React from 'react';
   import { PlasmicCanvasHost, registerComponent } from '@plasmicapp/react-web/lib/host';
 
   import { YourComponent, yourComponentMeta } from "your-library-name";
 
   registerComponent(YourComponent, yourComponentMeta);
 
   export default function PlasmicHost() {
     return <PlasmicCanvasHost />;
   }
   ```
 * If using loader API with nextjs, `plasmic-init.ts`:
    ```typescript
    import { initPlasmicLoader } from "@plasmicapp/loader-nextjs";

    import { YourComponent, yourComponentMeta } from "your-library-name";
    
    export const PLASMIC = initPlasmicLoader({
      projects: [
        {
          id: "your-project-id",
          token: "your-project-token",
        },
      ],
    
      preview: false,
    });

    PLASMIC.registerComponent(YourComponent, yourComponentMeta);
   ```

## Publishing

Once ready, you can publish to npm
1. Change version number in `package.json`
2. Run `npm publish` in terminal
3. Recommended: in your github repo create a release and tag corresponding with the commit that you published
